# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# never check-in as they contain passwords:
config/secrets.yml
config/database.yml
config/initializers/secret_token.rb
config/settings/

# Environment normalisation:
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle

# check-in these to normalise the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset

# ignore code-coverage files
/coverage/

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
